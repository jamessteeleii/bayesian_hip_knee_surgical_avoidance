AIM: To examine trends in the burden of hip, knee, hand and other OA related conditions in Australia from 1990 to 2019 and consider the OA burden in the context of other common conditions associated with older age. METHODS: Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 data for Australia on OA prevalence, OA-related years lived with disability (YLDs) and OA-related YLDs attributable to high body mass index (BMI) were sourced for 1990-2019. Age-standardised YLD data for ischaemic heart disease, stroke, dementia, type 2 diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were obtained for comparison. RESULTS: Overall, 3.20 million Australians were estimated to have OA in 2019, with substantial growth in the prevalence of hip (+171\%), knee (+126\%), hand (+110\%) and other types of OA (+130\%) from 1990 to 2019. Age-standardised prevalence rates reflect the contribution of population ageing. Concomitant growth in OA-related YLDs was also evident; knee OA and hand OA demonstrated the highest disease burden in 2019 (59\,684 and 41\,893 YLDs respectively). The proportion of knee OA burden attributable to high BMI was 36\% in 2019. In 2019, age-standardised YLD rates were higher for OA (313 per 100\,000 population) than other common conditions (range: 47 per 100\,000 (ischaemic heart disease) to 284 per 100\,000 (type 2 diabetes)). CONCLUSIONS: OA is an increasingly prevalent, impactful condition with a high non-fatal disease burden relative to other health conditions. Growth in OA populations and OA-related disability underscore the need for enhanced investment in prevention and management.},

Method Data on primary TKR procedures performed for OA in 2003 and 2013 were extracted from national arthroplasty registries in Australia, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Life tables and population data were also obtained for each country. Lifetime risk of TKR was calculated for 2003 and 2013 using registry, life table and population data. Results Marked international variation in lifetime risk of TKR was evident, with females consistently demonstrating the greatest risk. In 2013, Finland had the highest lifetime risk for females (22.8\%, 95\%CI 22.5--23.1\%) and Australia had the highest risk for males (15.4\%, 95\%CI 15.1--15.6\%). Norway had the lowest lifetime risk for females (9.7\%, 95\%CI 9.5--9.9\%) and males (5.8\%, 95\%CI 5.6--5.9\%) in 2013. All countries showed a significant rise in lifetime risk of TKR for both sexes over the 10-year study period, with the largest increases observed in Australia (females: from 13.6\% to 21.1\%; males: from 9.8\% to 15.4\%). Conclusions Using population-based data, this study identified significant increases in the lifetime risk of TKR in all five countries from 2003 to 2013. Lifetime risk of TKR was as high as 1 in 5 women in Finland, and 1 in 7 males in Australia. These risk estimates quantify the healthcare resource burden of knee OA at the population level, providing an important resource for public health policy development and healthcare planning.},

The present article summarises recommendations from recently published United Kingdom, Danish, Belgian and United States guidelines to alert readers to the important changes in recommendations for management, and the recommendations from previous guidelines that remain unchanged. Main recommendations: Use a clinical assessment to triage patients with LBP. Further diagnostic workup is only required for the small number of patients with suspected serious pathology. For many patients with non-specific LBP, simple first line care (advice, reassurance and self-management) and a review at 1--2 weeks is all that is required. If patients need second line care, non-pharmacological treatments (eg, physical and psychological therapies) should be tried before pharmacological therapies. If pharmacological therapies are used, they should be used at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest period of time possible. Exercise and/or cognitive behavioural therapy, with multidisciplinary treatment for more complex presentations, are recommended for patients with chronic LBP. Electrotherapy, traction, orthoses, bed rest, surgery, injections and denervation procedures are not recommended for patients with non-specific LBP. Changes in management as a result of the guidelines: The major changes include: 	emphasising simple first line care with early follow-up; 	encouraging non-pharmacological treatments over pharmacological treatments; and 	recommending against the use of surgery, injections and denervation procedures.},

  abstract = {Background GPs have high consultation rates for symptoms related to knee osteoarthritis (OA). Many risk factors for symptomatic knee OA progression remain unknown. Aim To define distinct knee pain trajectories in individuals with early symptomatic knee OA and determine the risk factors for these pain trajectories. Design and setting Data were obtained from the multicentre prospective Cohort Hip and Cohort Knee study in the Netherlands. Participants with knee OA, according to the clinical criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, and a completed 5-year follow-up were included. Method Baseline demographic, anamnestic, and physical examination characteristics were assessed. Outcome was annually assessed by the Numeric Rating Scale for pain. Pain trajectories were retrieved by latent class growth analysis. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate relative risk ratios. Results In total, 705 participants were included. Six distinct pain trajectories were identified with favourable and unfavourable courses. Statistically significant differences were found in baseline characteristics, including body mass index (BMI), symptom severity, and pain coping strategies between the different trajectories. Higher BMI, lower level of education, greater comorbidity, higher activity limitation scores, and joint space tenderness were more often associated with trajectories characterised by more pain at first presentation and pain progression --- compared with the reference group with a mild pain trajectory. No association was found for baseline radiographic features. Conclusion These results can help differentiate those patients who require more specific monitoring in the management of early symptomatic knee OA from those for whom a `wait-and-see' policy seems justifiable. Radiography provided no additional benefit over clinical diagnosis of early symptomatic knee OA in general practice.},

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate two 6-month, telehealth-delivered exercise programs, 1 with and 1 without dietary intervention. DESIGN: 3-group, parallel randomized (5:5:2) trial. (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12618000930280). SETTING: Australian private health insurance members. PARTICIPANTS: 415 persons with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis and a body mass index between 28 and 40 kg/m2 who were aged 45 to 80 years. INTERVENTION: All groups received access to electronic osteoarthritis information (control). The exercise program comprised 6 physiotherapist consultations via videoconference for exercise, self-management advice, and behavioral counseling, plus exercise equipment and resources. The diet and exercise program included an additional 6 dietitian consultations for a ketogenic very-low-calorie diet (2 formulated meal replacements and a low-carbohydrate meal daily) followed by a transition to healthy eating, as well as nutrition and behavioral resources. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were changes in knee pain (numerical rating scale [NRS] of 0 to 10, higher indicating worse) and physical function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC]; scale, 0 to 68, higher indicating worse) at 6 months (primary time point) and 12 months. Secondary outcomes were weight, physical activity, quality of life, mental health, global change, satisfaction, willingness to have surgery, orthopedic appointments, and knee surgery. RESULTS: A total of 379 participants (91\%) provided 6-month primary outcomes, and 372 (90\%) provided 12-month primary outcomes. At 6 months, both programs were superior to control for pain (between-group mean difference in change on NRS: diet and exercise, -1.5 [95\% CI, -2.1 to -0.8]; exercise, -0.8 [CI, -1.5 to -0.2]) and function (between-group mean difference in change on WOMAC: diet and exercise, -9.8 [CI, -12.5 to -7.0]; exercise, -7.0 [CI, -9.7 to -4.2]). The diet and exercise program was superior to exercise (pain, -0.6 [CI, -1.1 to -0.2]; function, -2.8 [CI, -4.7 to -0.8]). Findings were similar at 12 months. LIMITATION: Participants and clinicians were unblinded. CONCLUSION: Telehealth-delivered exercise and diet programs improved pain and function in people with knee osteoarthritis and overweight or obesity. A dietary intervention conferred modest additional pain and function benefits over exercise.

OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to compare the cost-effectiveness of 4 different combinations of exercise, manual therapy, and booster sessions for individuals with knee OA. DESIGN: This economic evaluation involved a cost-effectiveness analysis performed alongside a multicenter randomized controlled trial. SETTING: The study took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Salt Lake City, Utah; and San Antonio, Texas. PARTICIPANTS: The study participants were 300 individuals taking part in a randomized controlled trial investigating various physical therapy strategies for knee OA. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized into 4 treatment groups: exercise only (EX), exercise plus booster sessions (EX+B), exercise plus manual therapy (EX+MT), and exercise plus manual therapy and booster sessions (EX+MT+B). MEASUREMENTS: For the 2-year base case scenario, a Markov model was constructed using the United States societal perspective and a 3\% discount rate for costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to compare differences in cost per QALY gained among the 4 treatment strategies. RESULTS: In the 2-year analysis, booster strategies (EX+MT+B and EX+B) dominated no-booster strategies, with both lower health care costs and greater effectiveness. EX+MT+B had the lowest total health care costs. EX+B cost[Formula: see text]1061 more and gained 0.082 more QALYs than EX+MT+B, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of[Formula: see text]12,900/QALY gained. LIMITATIONS: The small number of total knee arthroplasty surgeries received by individuals in this study made the assessment of whether any particular strategy was more successful at delaying or preventing surgery in individuals with knee OA difficult. CONCLUSIONS: Spacing exercise-based physical therapy sessions over 12 months using periodic booster sessions was less costly and more effective over 2 years than strategies not containing booster sessions for individuals with knee OA.},

Methods Routinely collected data from Catalonia, Spain, covering 2006 to 2015, were used. Study participants had a newly recorded GP diagnosis of knee or hip osteoarthritis. Parametric survival models were specified for risk of knee/hip replacement and death following diagnosis. Survival models were combined using a Markov model and lifetime risk estimated for the average patient profile. The effects of age at diagnosis, sex, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, body mass index (BMI), and smoking on risk were assessed. Results 48,311 individuals diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis were included, of whom 2,561 underwent knee replacement. 15,105 individuals diagnosed with hip osteoarthritis were included, of whom 1,247 underwent hip replacement. The average participant's lifetime risk for knee replacement was 30\% (95\% CI: 25--36\%) and for hip replacement was 14\% (10--19\%). Notable patient characteristics influencing lifetime risk were age at diagnosis for knee and hip replacement, sex for hip replacement, and BMI for knee replacement. BMI increasing from 25 to 35 was associated with lifetime risk of knee replacement increasing from 24\% (20--28\%) to 32\% (26--37\%) for otherwise average patients. Conclusion Knee and hip replacement are not inevitable after an osteoarthritis diagnosis, with average lifetime risks of less than a third and a sixth, respectively. Patient characteristics, most notably BMI, influence lifetime risks.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the future rate of primary total hip (THR) or knee (TKR) replacement in the UK to 2035 allowing for changes in population demographics and obesity. DESIGN: Using age/gender/body mass index (BMI)-specific incidence rates from a population-based cohort study of 50,000 THR and 45,609 TKR patients from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) between 1991 and 2010, we projected future numbers of THR and TKR using two models: a static, estimated rate from 2010 applied to population growth forecasts to 2035, and a log-linear rate extrapolation over the same period. Both scenarios used population forecast data from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS). RESULTS: Assuming rates of THR and TKR for 2010, and given projected population changes in age, gender and BMI, the number of THRs and TKRs performed in the UK in 2035 is estimated to be, respectively: 95,877 and 118,666. By comparison, an exponential extrapolation of historical rates using a log-linear model produces much higher estimates of THR and TKR counts in 2035 at 439,097 and 1,219,362 respectively. Projected counts were higher for women than men. Assuming a changing (rather than fixed) future BMI distribution increases TKRs by 2035 but not THRs. CONCLUSIONS: Using historical rates and population forecasts we have projected the number of THR/TKR operations in the UK up to 2035. This study will inform policymakers requiring estimates of future demand for surgery. Incorporating future forecasts for BMI into projections of joint replacement may be more relevant for TKR rather than THR.},

  abstract = {Aim To describe the natural progression and the rates of arthroplasty of a cohort of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Methods An observational study of 247 consecutive patients who attended an OA clinic between May 2008 and August 2009. Follow-up survey was conducted from July 2014 to December 2014, with the primary end point being joint replacement surgery. Results One hundred and sixty-seven patients had knee OA and 80 patients had hip OA. When adjusted for other variables (age, gender, body mass index, Kellgren-Lawrence stage, symptom duration, presence of OA elsewhere and pain score), patients with hip OA demonstrated 86\% increased hazard of surgery compared to knee OA patients (95\% CI increase of 19\% to 193\%). At 6 years after initial consultation, 67\% of patients with knee OA did not require a knee replacement surgery, while 40\% (30, 51) of hip OA patients did not undergo surgery (95\% CI: 59--74\%). Overall at 6 years, 58\% of patients (95\% CI: 51--64\%) did not undergo joint replacement surgery. Conclusion Knee and hip OA patients appear to behave differently, with hip OA patients more likely to undergo arthroplasty. There is a significant number of both hip OA and knee OA patients who did not require arthroplasty at the end of 6 years, suggesting a major role for conservative therapy.},

The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes between a home-based physical therapy program and a clinically based physical therapy program. SUBJECTS: One hundred thirty-four subjects with OA of the knee were randomly assigned to a clinic treatment group (n=66; 61\% female, 39\% male; mean age [+/-SD]=64+/-10 years) or a home exercise group (n=68, 71\% female, 29\% male; mean age [+/-SD]=62+/-9 years). METHODS: Subjects in the clinic treatment group received supervised exercise, individualized manual therapy, and a home exercise program over a 4-week period. Subjects in the home exercise group received the same home exercise program initially, reinforced at a clinic visit 2 weeks later. Measured outcomes were the distance walked in 6 minutes and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). RESULTS: Both groups showed clinically and statistically significant improvements in 6-minute walk distances and WOMAC scores at 4 weeks; improvements were still evident in both groups at 8 weeks. By 4 weeks, WOMAC scores had improved by 52\% in the clinic treatment group and by 26\% in the home exercise group. Average 6-minute walk distances had improved about 10\% in both groups. At 1 year, both groups were substantially and about equally improved over baseline measurements. Subjects in the clinic treatment group were less likely to be taking medications for their arthritis and were more satisfied with the overall outcome of their rehabilitative treatment compared with subjects in the home exercise group. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Although both groups improved by 1 month, subjects in the clinic treatment group achieved about twice as much improvement in WOMAC scores than subjects who performed similar unsupervised exercises at home. Equivalent maintenance of improvements at 1 year was presumably due to both groups continuing the identical home exercise program. The results indicate that a home exercise program for patients with OA of the knee provides important benefit. Adding a small number of additional clinical visits for the application of manual therapy and supervised exercise adds greater symptomatic relief.},

The long-term cost-effectiveness of these programs is unclear.To estimate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of implementing a national structured education and exercise therapy program for individuals with knee osteoarthritis with the option for future TKR compared with usual care (TKR for all).This economic evaluation used a life table model in combination with a Markov model to compare costs and health outcomes of a national education and exercise therapy program vs usual care in the Australian health care system. Subgroup, deterministic, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were completed. A hypothetical cohort of adults aged 45 to 84 years who would undergo TKR was created.Structured education and exercise therapy intervention provided by physiotherapists. The comparator was usual care where all people undergo TKR without accessing the program in the first year.Incremental net monetary benefit (INMB), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold of 28\,033 Australian dollars (A\$) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, was calculated from a health care perspective. Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from national registries and a randomized clinical trial.The hypothetical cohort included 61\,394 individuals (53.9\% female; 93.6\% aged {$\geq$}55 years). Implementation of an education and exercise therapy program resulted in a lifetime cost savings of A\$498\,307\,942 (US \$339\,922\,227), or A\$7970 (US \$5537) per individual, and resulted in fewer QALYs (0.43 per individual) compared with usual care. At a population level, education and exercise therapy was not cost-effective at the lifetime horizon (INMB, -A\$4090 [-US \$2841]). Subgroup analysis revealed that the intervention was cost-effective only for the first 9 years and over a lifetime only in individuals with no or mild pain at baseline (INMB, A\$11 [US \$8]). Results were robust to uncertainty around model inputs.In this economic evaluation of structured education and exercise therapy compared with usual care, the intervention was not cost-effective over the lifetime for all patients but was for the first 9 years and for those with minimal pain. These findings point to opportunities to invest early cost savings in additional care or prevention, including targeted implementation to specific subgroups.},

Emerging areas of interest include selection of a minority of patients who may benefit from surgery based on spinal sagittal alignment and/or nuclear medicine scans, but an evidence base is absent.Spinal surgery for back pain has increased substantially over recent decades, and disproportionately among privately insured patients, thus the contribution of industry and third-party payers to this increase, and their involvement in published research, requires careful consideration.},

DESIGN: Multi-center, 2~\texttimes ~2 factorial randomized clinical trial. 300 participants with knee OA were randomized to four groups: exercise-no boosters (Ex), exercise-with boosters (Ex+B), manual therapy+exercise-no boosters (MT+Ex), manual therapy+exercise-with boosters (MT+Ex+B). The primary outcome was the Western Ontario and McMaster osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) at 1 year. Secondary outcomes included knee pain, physical performance tests, and proportions of participants meeting treatment responder criteria. RESULTS: There were no differences between groups on the WOMAC at 1 year or on any performance-based measures. Secondary analyses indicated a) better scores on the WOMAC and greater odds of being a treatment responder at 9 weeks for participants receiving MT, b) greater odds of being a treatment responder at 1 year for participants receiving boosters. Exploratory interaction analysis suggested knee pain decreases for participants receiving boosters and increases for participants not receiving boosters from 9 weeks to 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: MT or use of boosters with exercise did not result in additive improvement in the primary outcome at 1 year. Secondary outcomes suggest MT may have some short term benefit, and booster sessions may improve responder status and knee pain at 1 year. However, the role of booster sessions remains unclear in sustaining treatment effects and warrants further study. CLINICAL TRIALS: gov (NCT01314183).},

The SMART Registry is a pragmatic prospective database, which was established to capture a broad range of longitudinal clinical and patient-reported outcome data to facilitate collaborative research that will improve policy and practice relevant to arthroplasty surgery for people with advanced arthritis of the hip or knee. The purpose of this cohort profile paper is to describe the rationale for the SMART Registry's creation, its methods, baseline data and future plans for the Registry. A full compilation of the data is provided as a reference point for future collaborators. Participants The SMART Registry cohort comprises over 13 000 consecutive arthroplasty procedures in more than 10 000 patients who underwent their procedure at St Vincent's Hospital Melbourne, since January 1998. Participant recruitment, data collection and follow-up is ongoing and currently includes up to 20 years follow-up data. Findings to date SMART Registry data are used for clinical audit and feedback, as well as for a broad range of research including epidemiological studies, predictive statistical modelling and health economic evaluations. At the time of writing, there were 46 publications from SMART Registry data, with contributions from more than 67 coauthors. Future plans With the recent linking of the SMART Registry with Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme data through the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, research into prescribing patterns and health system utilisation is currently underway. The SMART Registry is also being updated with the Clavien-Dindo classification of surgical complications.},

  abstract = {\# Background Nearly twenty million people are affected by osteoarthritis (OA) across the UK. For end-stage knee OA, total knee replacement (TKR) is considered as the standard of care, but this major surgery carries high costs, long waiting lists, and risk for further revision surgeries. Health systems are therefore looking for effective alternatives to treat these cohorts, significantly delaying, and potentially avoiding joint replacement surgery altogether. The purpose of this study was to examine the 2-year surgery avoidance rate amongst TKR candidates that received a non-invasive biomechanical intervention. \# Methods A retrospective clinical audit was conducted on 365 NHS patients with end-stage knee OA patients eligible for TKR. Each patient was individually fitted with a non-invasive, shoe-like, biomechanical device, that alters the foot center of pressure, minimizes reported symptoms, and promotes neuromuscular control training using convex pods under the sole. Patients used the device for short periods during activities of daily living and were followed for two years. The primary outcome was surgery status after 2 years. Secondary outcomes were evaluated using the generalized linear mixed-models procedure and included changes in pain, function (WOMAC and Oxford Knee Score (OKS), and spatiotemporal gait measured at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months from baseline. \# Results Of the 365 candidates for TKR, 305 (84\%) avoided surgery at 2 years. Patients displayed significant clinical improvements over time. Six months after starting treatment, average pain decreased by 42\%, average function improved by 39\%, and average OKS increased by 7.6 points. These continued to improve over the 2 years. All spatial-temporal gait measures improved over time (p{$<$}0.001). \# Conclusions The current results suggest that a non-invasive biomechanical treatment may help end-stage knee OA patients delay knee replacement surgery for at least 2 years or avoid it altogether. This treatment may provide an effective non-surgical alternative for managing these patients in the community, alleviating pain, and improving gait and function.},

  abstract = {Background Nonoperative management of patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) through multidisciplinary programs may delay or reduce the need for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, avoidance of surgery may not represent success for the patient. Methods A cohort of 120 patients with knee OA managed with at least 6 months of supervised nonoperative treatment coordinated through the Joint Clinic were reviewed at 5 years. Outcomes including Oxford knee score (OKS), Short Form 12 (SF-12), and SF-6D and other measures including analgesia use, global change, and perception of need for surgery were collected and compared with those from the cohort who had undergone TKA. Results Seventy (62.5\%) surviving patients were still being managed nonoperatively. There was no significant change in any outcome score (OKS, SF-12 physical component score, SF-12 mental component score, SF-6D) (P~= .26 to .84). Forty-two patients had undergone TKA with mean time to surgery 29.0 months (range, 9-69 months). In this group, the mean OKS fell from 17.9 at baseline to 10.3 (range, 3-21) preoperatively (P {$<$} .0001) and at 5 years there was a significant improvement from baseline in OKS, SF-12 physical component score, and SF-6D scores (P {$<$} .0001). All outcome scores and change in scores were significantly higher for the surgical group (all P {$<$} .001). Conclusion Although a high proportion of patients with knee OA have avoided surgery at 5 years, their outcomes show no improvement from baseline and are poorer than those who have undergone TKA.

  abstract = {Background Exercise is recommended for hip osteoarthritis, but the most effective programmes for management of symptoms are unknown. We aimed to investigate whether adding aerobic physical activity to resistance exercise would improve hip pain and function more than resistance exercise alone in individuals with hip osteoarthritis. Methods PHOENIX was a randomised comparative effectiveness trial done in Melbourne, Australia. We recruited people with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic hip osteoarthritis. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1, by use of a web-based system) to aerobic physical activity and resistance exercise or resistance exercise only. Both groups received a home exercise programme and nine consultations with a physiotherapist over 3 months. The co-primary outcomes were change in hip pain severity (numerical rating scale [NRS] 0--10, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes) and function (Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index [WOMAC]; scale 0--68, with higher scores indicating worse outcomes) at 3 months. Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. People with lived experience of hip osteoarthritis were involved in the design of the study. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN 12619001297112), and is complete. Findings Between Oct 15, 2019, and Sept 13, 2022, 196 participants (134 [68\%] women and 62 [32\%] men) were randomly assigned to aerobic physical activity and resistance exercise (n=97) or resistance exercise only (n=99). At 3 months, aerobic physical activity and resistance exercise was not more effective in improving hip pain severity (mean difference 0{$\cdot$}3 [95\% CI --0{$\cdot$}3 to 0{$\cdot$}8; p=0{$\cdot$}36]) or function (mean difference --0{$\cdot$}9 [95\% CI --3{$\cdot$}6 to 1{$\cdot$}8; p=0{$\cdot$}51]) compared with resistance exercise alone, with both showing a mean improvement in pain (2{$\cdot$}4 [SD 1{$\cdot$}9] with aerobic physical activity and resistance exercise vs 2{$\cdot$}2 [2{$\cdot$}1] with resistance exercise only) and function (7{$\cdot$}0 [10{$\cdot$}4] with aerobic physical activity and resistance exercise vs 8{$\cdot$}9 [10{$\cdot$}8] resistance exercise only). There were 24 related adverse events with aerobic physical activity and resistance exercise, and 31 with resistance exercise only, none of which were serious. Interpretation Despite improvement in pain and function in both groups, adding moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity to resistance exercise did not lead to superior outcomes. Future work could consider higher intensity interval training before concluding no symptomatic benefit of adding aerobic exercise or physical activity to resistance exercise.

  abstract = {Preoperative exercise (prehabilitation) is commonly used as a method to reduce pain and improve function postoperatively. The purpose of this systematic review was to determine therapeutic benefits of preoperative exercise on postoperative pain, function, quality of life (QOL), and risk of complications across various types of surgeries.Three electronic databases were used to perform a literature search. Full articles with randomized designs comparing a preoperative exercise program vs no formal program were included. The primary outcome was postoperative pain. QOL, function, and postoperative complications were analyzed as secondary outcomes. The primary meta-analysis was performed in those with joint replacement surgery because there were only 5 with other surgical types.A total of 28 articles were included, of which 23 were from individuals with total joint replacement surgery. Preoperative exercise resulted in lower pain {$\leq$}2~months and 3 to 5~months after joint replacement surgery with a moderate standardized mean difference (95\% CI at \&lt;2~months\,=\,-0.34 [-0.59 to -0.09]; at 3 to 5~months\,=\,-0.41 [-0.70 to -0.11]) compared with nonexercised controls. However, {$\geq$}6~months after joint replacement surgery, preoperative exercise groups showed no significant differences in postoperative pain (standardized mean difference =\,-0.17 [-0.35 to 0.01]) compared with nonexercised controls. QOL and subjective and objective function were improved {$\leq$}2~months after joint replacement surgery but were not different {$\geq$}6~months post-surgery. Reduction in risk of postoperative complications was favored with preoperative exercise.Preoperative exercise has a modest effect on postoperative pain, function, and quality of life within the first 6~months after surgery and reduces the risk of developing postoperative complications in individuals undergoing joint replacement surgery. The effect of preoperative exercise on other surgery types is inconclusive.This systematic review supports using preoperative exercise to improve pain and function outcomes for those with joint replacement surgery.},

Design Systematic review with meta-analysis. Data sources Medline, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL and SportDiscus databases were searched from inception to January 2018. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Randomised controlled trials investigating the effect of adding hip exercises to quadriceps exercises in people with KOA on pain, function and/or quality of life were included. Three subgroups of hip exercises were included: resistance, functional neuromuscular or multimodal exercise. Results Eight studies were included. Pooled data provide evidence that combined hip and quadriceps exercise is significantly more effective than quadriceps exercise alone for improving walking function (standardised mean difference -1.06, 95\% CI -2.01 to -0.12), but not for outcomes of pain (-0.09, 95\% CI --0.96 to 0.79), patient-reported function (-0.74, 95\% CI --1.56 to 0.08) or stair function (-0.7, 95\% CI --1.67 to 0.26). Subgroup analyses reveal that hip resistance exercises are more effective than functional neuromuscular exercises for improving pain (p{$<$}0.0001) and patient-reported function (p{$<$}0.0001). Multimodal exercise is no more effective than quadriceps strengthening alone for pain (0.13, 95\% CI --0.31 to 0.56), patient-reported function (-0.15, 95\% CI --0.58 to 0.29) or stair function (0.13, 95\% CI --0.3 to 0.57). Conclusion Walking improved after the addition of hip strengthening to quadriceps strengthening in people with KOA. The addition of resistance hip exercises to quadriceps resulted in greater improvements in patientreported pain and function.},

  abstract = {AIM: This study aimed to estimate the demand for total hip (THR) and knee replacements (TKR) by 2026 within New Zealand (NZ) and show how demographic factors are likely to influence this projection. METHOD: Yearly population data from the NZ Census was compared to the NZ Joint Register from 2001-2011 and ethnic and gender specific data was organised into 5 year age groups from 35 years to calculate the incidence for each age group. Poisson regression analysis was used to project the incidence for 2026 and to evaluate the independent associations between age, gender and ethnicity. RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2011 the incidence of THR and TKR increased by 8.20\% and 52.20\% respectively with a peak incidence in the 70-74 age group. Men were less likely to undergo both THR and TKR (OR 0.91, 95\% CI 0.89-0.94 and OR 0.88, 95\% CI 0.89-0.90). By 2026 the absolute number of THR and TKR is estimated to increase by 84\% (8950 procedures) and 183\% (8613 procedures) respectively. Europeans were the most likely to undergo THR compared to Maori, Pacific people or Asians (OR 0.72, 95\% CI 0.67-0.74). There was a large increase in the age standardised incidence of TKR for Pacific people and they were more likely to undergo TKR than Europeans (OR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.97-1.04). CONCLUSION: Over the past decade, incidence of THR and TKR have increased, and by 2026, the number of THR and TKR is projected to increase by 84\% and 183\% respectively. This increase will create a significant socioeconomic burden which will necessitate prudent and focused healthcare strategies to ensure that there are adequate resources to meet this demand.},

However, randomized controlled trials providing evidence for the optimal exercise type are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether progressive resistance training (PRT) is superior to neuromuscular exercise (NEMEX) for improving functional performance in patients with hip OA. DESIGN: Multicenter, cluster-randomized, controlled, parallel-group, assessor-blinded, superiority trial. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04714047). SETTING: Hospitals and physiotherapy clinics. PARTICIPANTS: 160 participants with clinically diagnosed hip OA were enrolled from 18 January 2021 to 28 April 2023 and randomly assigned to PRT (n = 82) or NEMEX (n = 78). INTERVENTION: Twelve weeks of PRT or NEMEX with 2 supervised 60-minute group sessions each week. The PRT intervention consisted of 5 high-intensity resistance training exercises targeting muscles at the hip and knee joints. The NEMEX intervention included 10 exercises and emphasized sensorimotor control and functional stability. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was change in the 30-second chair stand test (30s-CST). Key secondary outcomes were changes in scores on the pain and hip-related quality of life (QoL) subscales of the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS). RESULTS: The mean changes from baseline to 12-week follow-up in the 30s-CST were 1.5 (95\% CI, 0.9 to 2.1) chair stands with PRT and 1.5 (CI, 0.9 to 2.1) chair stands with NEMEX (difference, 0.0 [CI, -0.8 to 0.8] chair stands). For the HOOS pain subscale, mean changes were 8.6 (CI, 5.3 to 11.8) points with PRT and 9.3 (CI, 5.9 to 12.6) points with NEMEX (difference, -0.7 [CI, -5.3 to 4.0] points). For the HOOS QoL subscale, mean changes were 8.0 (CI, 4.3 to 11.7) points with PRT and 5.7 (CI, 1.9 to 9.5) points with NEMEX (difference, 2.3 [CI, -3.0 to 7.6] points). LIMITATION: Participants and physiotherapists were not blinded. CONCLUSION: In patients with hip OA, PRT is not superior to NEMEX for improving functional performance, hip pain, or hip-related QoL.

The purpose of this study was to formulate projections for the number of primary and revision total hip and knee arthroplasties that will be performed in the United States through 2030. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (1990 to 2003) was used in conjunction with United States Census Bureau data to quantify primary and revision arthroplasty rates as a function of age, gender, race and/or ethnicity, and census region. Projections were performed with use of Poisson regression on historical procedure rates in combination with population projections from 2005 to 2030. RESULTS: By 2030, the demand for primary total hip arthroplasties is estimated to grow by 174\% to 572,000. The demand for primary total knee arthroplasties is projected to grow by 673\% to 3.48 million procedures. The demand for hip revision procedures is projected to double by the year 2026, while the demand for knee revisions is expected to double by 2015. Although hip revisions are currently more frequently performed than knee revisions, the demand for knee revisions is expected to surpass the demand for hip revisions after 2007. Overall, total hip and total knee revisions are projected to grow by 137\% and 601\%, respectively, between 2005 and 2030. CONCLUSIONS: These large projected increases in demand for total hip and knee arthroplasties provide a quantitative basis for future policy decisions related to the numbers of orthopaedic surgeons needed to perform these procedures and the deployment of appropriate resources to serve this need.},

To investigate the effect of muscle strength exercise training (MSET) on lean mass (LM) gain and muscle hypertrophy in older patients with lower extremity osteoarthritis (OA). Methods. A comprehensive search of online databases was performed on April 20, 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported the effects of MSET on LM, muscle thickness, and cross-sectional area (CSA) in older patients with OA were identified. A risk of bias assessment and meta-analysis were performed for the included RCTs. Results. We included 19 RCTs with a median Physiotherapy Evidence Database score of 6 of 10 (range 3--7). In total, data from 1,195 patients (65\% women, 85\% with knee OA) with a mean age of 62.1 years (range 40--86 years) were analyzed. MSET resulted in significantly higher LM gain (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.49 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 0.28, 0.71], P {$<$} 0.00001) than did the nonexercise controls. Meta-analysis results revealed significantly positive effects of MSET on muscle thickness (SMD 0.82 [95\% CI 0.20, 1.43], P = 0.009) and CSA (SMD 0.80 [95\% CI 0.25, 1.35], P = 0.004) compared with nonexercise controls. No significant effects in favor of MSET were observed for any muscle outcome compared with exercise controls. Five RCTs reported nonsevere adverse events in response to MSET, whereas no RCTs reported severe events. Conclusion. MSET is effective in increasing LM and muscle size in older adults with OA. Clinicians should incorporate MSET into their management of patients at risk of low muscle mass to maximize health status, particularly for older individuals with OA.},

The purpose of this study was to determine dose parameters for resistance exercise associated with improvements in pain and physical function in knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) and whether these improvements were related to adherence. Methods. We searched six databases, from inception to January 28, 2023, for randomized controlled trials comparing land-based, resistance exercise--only interventions with no intervention, or any other intervention. There were four subgroups of intervention duration: 0 to {$<$}3 months, 3 to 6 months, {$>$}6 to {$<$}12 months, {$\geq$}12 months. The between-group effect was calculated for immediate postintervention pain and physical function (activities of daily living [ADL] and sports/recreation [SPORT]). Results. For both knee and hip, data from 280 studies showed moderate benefit for pain, physical function ADL, and physical function SPORT in favor of interventions 3 to 6 months. For the knee, there was also a moderate benefit for physical function ADL in favor of interventions {$>$}6 to {$<$}12 months. From 151 knee and hip studies that provided total exercise volume data (frequency, time, duration), there was no association between volume with the effect size for pain and physical function. A total of 74 studies (69 knee, 5 hip) reported usable adherence data. There was no association between adherence with the effect size for pain and physical function. Conclusion. In knee and hip OA, resistance exercise interventions 3 to 6 months (and for the knee {$>$}6 to {$<$}12 months) duration improve pain and physical function. Improvements do not depend on exercise volume or adherence, suggesting exercise does not require rigid adherence to a specific dose.},

Rehabilitation for this population focuses on strengthening the hip muscles, particularly the abductors, however the deficit in function of these muscles is unclear. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence for the differences in structure and function of hip abductors (gluteus medius and minimus and tensor fascia lata) in hip OA. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, AMED, CINAHL and SportDISCUS, from the earliest date to September 2013. Studies that compared hip OA patients with controls, or the unaffected contralateral hip were included. Studies needed to report data on an outcome related to gross gluteal muscle function. RESULTS: An initial yield of 141 studies was reduced to 22 after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. Meta-analysis confirmed greater hip abductor strength in the control group (standardized mean difference = SMD -0.93, 95\%CI -1.70 to -0.16) and the unaffected limb (SMD -0.26, 95\%CI -0.48 to -0.04). Meta-analyses showed no differences in muscle size either between groups or limbs. Few electromyography studies have been reported and meta-analysis was not possible. CONCLUSION: Hip abductor strength is reduced in OA patients when compared to healthy controls and to the unaffected limb. Data on muscle size and activity is limited.},

Design Systematic review with network and component network meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Data sources Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were initially searched 1 March 2022, and updated on 25 October 2023. Certainty in findings were assessed using the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) approach. Main outcome measures To compare treatments and to compare individual components informed by partnership with patients, clinicians, researchers, and health system leaders using an integrated knowledge translation framework. Eligible studies were any randomised controlled trial including adults preparing for major surgery who were allocated to prehabilitation interventions or usual care, and where critical outcomes were reported. Results 186 unique randomised controlled trials with 15 684 participants were included. When comparing treatments using random-effects network meta-analysis, isolated exercise (odds ratio 0.50 (95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.64); very low certainty of evidence), isolated nutritional (0.62 (0.50 to 0.77); very low certainty of evidence), and combined exercise, nutrition, plus psychosocial (0.64 (0.45 to 0.92); very low certainty of evidence) prehabilitation were most likely to reduce complications compared with usual care. Combined exercise and psychosocial (-2.44 days (95\% CI -3.85 to -1.04); very low certainty of evidence), combined exercise and nutrition (--1.22 days (--2.54 to 0.10); moderate certainty of evidence), isolated exercise (--0.93 days (--1.27 to --0.58); very low certainty of evidence), and isolated nutritional prehabilitation (--0.99 days (--1.49 to --0.48); very low certainty of evidence) were most likely to decrease length of stay. Combined exercise, nutrition, plus psychosocial prehabilitation was most likely to improve health related quality of life (mean difference on Short Form-36 physical component scale 3.48 (95\% CI 0.82 to 6.14); very low certainty of evidence) and physical recovery (mean difference in meters on the six min walk test 43.43 (95\% CI 5.96 to 80.91); very low certainty of evidence).When comparing individual components using component network meta-analysis, exercise and nutrition were the individual components most likely to improve all critical outcomes. The certainty of evidence for all comparisons across all outcomes was generally low to very low due to trial level risk of bias and imprecision; however, results for exercise and nutritional prehabilitation were robust with exclusion of high risk of bias trials. Conclusions Consistent and potentially meaningful effect estimates suggest that exercise prehabilitation, nutritional prehabilitation, and multicomponent interventions including exercise may benefit adults preparing for surgery and could be considered in clinical care. However, multicentre trials that are appropriately powered for high priority outcomes and that have a low risk of bias are required to have greater certainty in prehabilitation's efficacy.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine if patients recommended for spinal surgery can avoid the surgery through an aggressive strengthening program. SETTING: A privately owned clinic, staffed by physicians and physical therapists, that provides treatment for patients with neck and/or back pain. METHODS: Over a period of 2 1/2 years, consecutive patients referred to the clinic for evaluation and treatment were enrolled in the study if they (1) had a physician's recommendation for lumbar or cervical surgery, (2) had no medical condition preventing exercise, and (3) were willing to participate in the approximately 10-week outpatient program. Treatment consisted mainly of intensive, progressive resistance exercise of the isolated lumbar or cervical spine. Exercise was continued to failure, and patients were encouraged to work through their pain. Third-party payors in Minneapolis were surveyed for average costs. Average follow-up occurred 16 months after discharge. RESULTS: Forty-six of the 60 participants completed the program; 38 were available for follow-up and three required surgery after completing the program. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: Despite methodologic limitations, the results are intriguing. A large number of patients who had been told they needed surgery were able to avoid surgery in the short term by aggressive strengthening exercise. This study suggests the need to define precisely what constitutes "adequate conservative care."},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The continuously increasing demand for joint replacement surgery in the past decades imposes higher constraints on the budgets of hospitals and healthcare providers. We undertook an analysis of historical trends in total hip replacement performed in Sweden between 1968 and 2012 in order to provide projections of future demand. DATA AND METHODS: We obtained data on total hip replacements registered every year and on the evolution of the Swedish population between 1968 and 2012. We assumed the existence of a maximum incidence. So we adopted a regression framework that assumes the existence of an upper limit of total hip replacement incidence. RESULTS: We found that the incidence of total hip replacement will continue to increase until a projected upper incidence level of about 400 total hip replacements per 10(5) Swedish residents aged 40 years and older will be reached around the year 2107. In 2020, the estimated incidence of total hip replacement will be 341 (95\% prediction interval (PI): 302-375) and in 2030 it will be 358 (PI: 317-396). Using official forecasted population growth data, about 18,000 operations would be expected to be performed in 2020 and 20,000 would be expected to be performed in 2030. INTERPRETATION: Growing incidence, population growth, and increasing life expectancy will probably result in increased demand for hip replacement surgery. Our findings could serve as a basis for decision making.},

  abstract = {Objectives General practitioners (GPs) are often the first health professionals to assess patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Despite clinical guideline recommendations for non-surgical intervention as first-line therapies, the most frequent referral from a GP for a person with knee OA is to an orthopaedic surgeon. The aim of our study was to explore patient factors that impact on the decision to progress to total knee replacement (TKR), including the experience of patients in general practice, their perceptions of their condition, and their access and use of community-based allied health interventions. Design Qualitative investigation using semi-structured interviews. The Candidacy framework was selected as a lens to examine the factors driving healthcare access. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Codes identified in the data were mapped to the seven Candidacy domains. Themes corresponding to each domain were described. Setting A public hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Participants 27 patients with knee OA who were on a waiting list to undergo TKR. Results Ten themes described factors influencing access and use of non-surgical interventions and decision-making for undergoing TKR: (1) History of knee problems, change in symptoms; (2) Physical and psychosocial functioning (Identification of Candidacy); (3) GP and social networks as information sources, access to care (Navigation); (4) Referral pathways (Permeability of services); (5) Communication of impact (Appearances at health services); (6) GP-Surgeon as the predominant referral pathway (Adjudications); (7) Physical activity as painful; (8) Beliefs about effectiveness of non-surgical interventions (Offers and resistance); (9) Familiarity with local system; and (10) Availability (Operating conditions and local production of Candidacy). Conclusions Using the Candidacy framework to analyse patients' experiences when deciding to progress to TKR highlighted missed opportunities in general practice to orient patients to first try non-surgical interventions. Patients with knee OA also require improved support to navigate allied health services.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The annual number of total hip arthroplasties (THA) has increased in Denmark over the past 15 years. There is, however, limited detailed data available on the incidence of THAs. METHODS: We calculated the incidence rates (IR) of primary THA and revision in Denmark between 1996 and 2002 and estimated the demands for primary THA in Denmark until 2020. We used data from the Danish Hip Arthroplasty Registry, a nationwide and population-based clinical database, to identify patients who had undergone primary THA (n = 37,144) or revision arthroplasties (n = 6446). Age and sex-specific data on the Danish population were obtained from the StatBank Denmark. All IRs were standardized according to two standards, i.e. the Danish population in 1996 and the European standard population (18 age groups). The future demands for primary THA were estimated using the age and sex-specific incidence of primary THA for 2002 as a reference, and taking into account the expected changes in the age distribution of the population and the trend in IRs seen in Denmark between 1996 and 2002. RESULTS: The annual overall standardized IRs of primary THAs and revisions increased from 101 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 97.6-104) to 134 (CI: 131-138) and from 19.2 (CI: 17.9-20.5) to 21.1 (CI: 19.8-22.4) per 100,000 inhabitants from 1996 to 2002, respectively (IRs adjusted to the Danish population in 1996). The IRs of primary THAs and revisions increased by 30\% and 10\% during this period. The relative increase in IRs of primary THAs was found to be similar in both women and men. The increase was higher among patients aged 50-59 years, however. Furthermore, a decrease in IRs was seen in patients who underwent primary THA due to rheumatoid arthritis. IRs of primary THAs have been estimated to increase by 22\% in 2020 compared with 2002, based only on the expected changes in the age distribution of the population. However, assuming that the annual age and sex-independent increase in the IRs seen in the period 1996-2002 will continue, the IR of primary THA is estimated to increase by as much as 210\% in 2020. INTERPRETATION: The overall annual standardized IRs of primary THAs and revisions in Denmark increased during the period from 1996 to 2002. Moreover, the demands for THA procedures in the coming decades may exceed the current capacity due to the ageing population and a continued age and sex-independent increase in surgical activity.},

Method Long-term follow-up study of a single blind cluster randomized trial comparing BGA and UC. One hundred and forty-nine patients out of the 200 included were followed until 60 months' follow-up. Primary outcome measures were pain, physical function, and patient global assessment. Furthermore, patient-oriented physical function, physical performance, health care utilization and the number of joint replacement surgeries were assessed. Assessments took place at 3, 9, 15 and 60 months' follow-up. Data were analyzed according to intent-to-treat principle. Results Both treatments showed beneficial within-groups effects in the long-term. In patients with knee OA no differences between treatments were found on the short-, mid-long and long-term. In patients with hip OA significant differences in favor of BGA were found at 3 months' (pain and physical performance) and 9 months' follow-up (pain, physical function, patients global assessment and patient-oriented physical function). Furthermore, UC resulted in patients with hip OA in more joint replacement surgeries compared to BGA (hazard ratio [HR], 2.87; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.1; 7.3). Conclusion No differences between treatment groups were found in the long-term on the primary outcome measures. Although more research is needed to confirm the study findings, the results indicate that BGA reduces the risk for joint replacement surgeries compared to UC in patients with hip OA, which probably can be explained by better outcome in favor of BGA in the short- and mid-long-term.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To estimate the future direct cost of OA in Canada using a population-based health microsimulation model of osteoarthritis (POHEM-OA). METHODS: We used administrative health data from the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, a survey of a random sample of BC residents diagnosed with OA (Ministry of Health of BC data), Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI) cost data and literature estimates to populate a microsimulation model. Cost components associated with pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, total joint replacement (TJR) surgery, as well as use of hospital resources and management of complications arising from the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) were included. Future costs were then simulated using the POHEM-OA model to construct profiles for each adult Canadian. RESULTS: From 2010 to 2031, as the prevalence of OA is projected to increase from 13.8\% to 18.6\%, the total direct cost of OA is projected to increase from \$2.9 billion to \$7.6 billion, an almost 2.6-fold increase (in 2010 \$CAD). From the highest to the lowest, the cost components that will constitute the total direct cost of OA in 2031 are hospitalization cost (\$2.9 billion), outpatient services (\$1.2 billion), alternative care and out-of-pocket cost categories (\$1.2 billion), drugs (\$1 billion), rehabilitation (\$0.7 billion) and side-effect of drugs (\$0.6 billion). CONCLUSIONS: Projecting the future trends in the cost of OA enables policy makers to anticipate the significant shifts in its distribution of burden in the future.},

Methods 100 adults with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis found eligible for TKR by an orthopaedic surgeon in secondary care were randomised to TKR plus 12 weeks of supervised non-surgical treatment (exercise, education, diet, insoles and pain medication) or to supervised non-surgical treatment alone. Including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) data from baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, effectiveness was measured as change at 24 months. Healthcare costs and transfer payments were derived from national registries. Incremental healthcare costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted and the probability of cost-effectiveness was estimated at the 22 665 Euros/QALY threshold defined by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Results TKR plus non-surgical treatment was more expensive (mean of 23 076 vs 14 514 Euros) but also more effective than non-surgical treatment (mean 24-month improvement in QALY of 0.195 vs 0.056). While cost-effective in the unadjusted scenario (ICER of 18 497 Euros/QALY), TKR plus non-surgical treatment was not cost-effective compared with non-surgical treatment with the option of later TKR if needed in the adjusted (age, sex and baseline values), base-case scenario (ICER of 32 611 Euros/QALY) with a probability of cost-effectiveness of 23.2\%. Including deaths, TKR plus non-surgical treatment was still not cost-effective (ICERs of 46 277 to 64 208 Euros/QALY). Conclusions From a 24-month perspective, TKR plus non-surgical treatment does not appear to be cost-effective compared with non-surgical treatment with the option of later TKR if needed in patients with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis and moderate intensity pain in secondary care in Denmark. Results were sensitive to changes, highlighting the need for further confirmatory research also assessing the long-term cost-effectiveness of TKR.

  abstract = {Objectives To compare 2-year outcomes of total knee replacement (TKR) followed by non-surgical treatment to that of non-surgical treatment alone and outcomes of the same non-surgical treatment to that of written advice. Design In two randomized trials, 200 (mean age 66) adults with moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis (OA), 100 eligible for TKR and 100 not eligible for TKR, were randomized to TKR followed by non-surgical treatment, non-surgical treatment alone, or written advice. Non-surgical treatment consisted of 12 weeks of supervised exercise, education, dietary advice, use of insoles, and pain medication. The primary outcome was the mean score of the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) subscales, covering pain, symptoms, activities of daily living (ADL), and quality of life (QOL). Results Patients randomized to TKR had greater improvements than patients randomized to non-surgical treatment alone (difference of 18.3 points (95\% CI; 11.3 to 25.3)), who in turn improved more than patients randomized to written advice (difference of 7.0 points (95\% CI; 0.4 to 13.5)). Among patients eligible for TKR, 16 (32\%) from the non-surgical group underwent TKR during 2 years and among those initially ineligible, seven patients (14\%) from the non-surgical group and ten (20\%) from the written advice group underwent TKR. Conclusions TKR followed by non-surgical treatment is more effective on pain and function than non-surgical treatment alone, which in turn is more effective than written advice. Two out of three patients with moderate to severe knee OA eligible for TKR delayed surgery for at least 2 years following non-surgical treatment.

  abstract = {Background: For patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to provide meaningful information to support clinical care, we need to understand the magnitude of change that matters to patients. The aim of this study was to estimate minimal clinically important changes (MCICs) for the 12-item Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS-12) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS-12) among people undergoing joint replacement for osteoarthritis. Methods: Individual-level data from the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry's pilot PROMs program were used for this analysis. Preoperative and 6-month postoperative HOOS-12 and KOOS-12 domain and summary impact scores plus a rating of patient-perceived change after surgery (on a 5-point scale ranging from ``much worse'' to ``much better'') were available. Three anchor-based approaches---mean change, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) based on Youden's J statistic, and predictive modeling using a binary logistic regression model---were used to calculate MCICs based on patient-perceived change. Results: Data were available for 1,490 patients treated with total hip replacement (THR) (mean age, 66 years; 54\% female) and 1,931 patients treated with total knee replacement (TKR) (mean age, 66 years; 55\% female). Using the mean change method, the MCIC ranged from 24.0 to 27.5 points for the HOOS-12 and 17.5 to 21.8 points for the KOOS-12. The ROC analyses generated comparable MCIC values (28.1 for HOOS-12 and a range of 15.6 to 21.9 for KOOS-12) with high sensitivity and specificity. Lower estimates were derived from predictive modeling following adjustment for the proportion of improved patients (range, 15.7 to 19.2 for HOOS-12 and 14.2 to 16.5 for KOOS-12). Conclusions: We report MCIC values for the HOOS-12 and KOOS-12 instruments that we derived using 3 different methods. As estimates obtained using predictive modeling can be adjusted for the proportion of improved patients, these may be the most clinically applicable. These MCIC values can be used to interpret important changes in pain, function, and quality of life from the patient's perspective.},

  abstract = {Background Exercise treatment is recommended for all patients with hip osteoarthritis (OA), but its effect on the long-term need for total hip replacement (THR) is unknown. Methods We conducted a long-term follow-up of a randomised trial investigating the efficacy of exercise therapy and patient education versus patient education only on the 6-year cumulative survival of the native hip to THR in 109 patients with symptomatic and radiographic hip OA. Results regarding the primary outcome measure of the trial, self-reported pain at 16 months follow-up, have been reported previously. Results There were no group differences at baseline. The response rate at follow-up was 94\%. 22 patients in the group receiving both exercise therapy and patient education and 31 patients in the group receiving patient education only underwent THR during the follow-up period, giving a 6-year cumulative survival of the native hip of 41\% and 25\%, respectively (p=0.034). The HR for survival of the native hip was 0.56 (CI 0.32 to 0.96) for the exercise therapy group compared with the control group. Median time to THR was 5.4 and 3.5 years, respectively. The exercise therapy group had better self-reported hip function prior to THR or end of study, but no significant differences were found for pain and stiffness. Conclusions Our findings in this explanatory study suggest that exercise therapy in addition to patient education can reduce the need for THR by 44\% in patients with hip OA.

  abstract = {Background: Globally osteoarthritis of the knee is a leading cause of disability. Hip abductor strength and activation are essential for maintaining postural balance during transfers and are related to joint loading and progression during weight-bearing activities. Strength deficits in the hip abductors might cause a reduction in the lower extremity force generation, thereby causing stress on the medial tibiofemoral joint. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the effectiveness of hip abductor strengthening on knee joint loading, knee pain and functional outcome measures in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Methods: Database such as Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) database and PEDro were reviewed to recognize the trials published in English from inception to December 2020. Randomized controlled trials that studied the effectiveness of hip abductor strengthening in subjects with knee osteoarthritis and its impact on knee joint loading, knee pain and functional outcome measures were included. RevMan 5.4 was used for meta-analysis and forest plot construction. Quality assessment of the included studies was carried out using the PEDro scale. Results and discussion: The search yielded 260 results of which 29 full-text articles were screened. The review includes 7 randomized controlled trials and 3 studies with good methodological quality were included for metaanalysis. The meta-analysis of the articles favored hip abductor strengthening intervention over the control group. Hip abductor strengthening had significantly reduced the VAS [ SMD = -0.60[-0.88, -0.33] p {$<$} 0.0001]at 95\% CI and improved the WOMAC scores [SMD -- 0.75[-1.05,-0.45] p {$<$} 0.0001] at 95\% CI. All of the included studies concluded that strengthening the hip abductor muscle had a positive impact on knee pain and functional outcomes. Conclusion: The current study found high-quality evidence to support the use of hip abductor muscle strengthening exercises as a rehabilitative treatment for subjects with knee osteoarthritis.
